# The Research Repositories Project 
Last year, we kicked off another global effort within the [ResearchOps Community](https://researchops.community/) -- to explore how we can contribute to the fast-changing field of research repositories. 

> A research repository is any platform, system, drive, database, content collaboration tool, library, knowledge base, wiki, or file cabinet that stores research data, notes, transcripts, images, videos, recordings, findings, insights, reports, metadata, etc. to support consumption and reuse by the entire team. And yes, that means that every researcher is interacting with a “repository” already. 

We have embarked on a series of research activities, both online and in-person, to understand how people think about and interact with their libraries of research data. Using 1:1 interviews, surveys, experience mapping workshops, and diary studies, we are defining the nature of the problem space, the user needs, patterns of reasoning and guiding principles, understanding the types of artifacts that people have or plan to store, and the processes, interactions, and decisions involved in creating and ethically using research repositories. 

Our intention with this project is to leverage the community to conduct research, map out the problem space, construct shared definitions, taxonomies, and models, prescribe good governance and guidelines, and develop guidance for building, comparing, and evaluating research repositories. But the truly worthwhile parts happen along the way, as we create opportunities for researchers to reflect on the work they have done and the ways they want to grow as practitioners and leaders, to engage with members of the community in their own locales or across the globe to commiserate, support, and learn from each other, and to create a path forward together in the land of research repositories. 

_for Mark -- this is an example of including an image. the trick is to go to Issues on the top page menu, then hit the Add a new issue button, and then drag your image file into the big box, where it will be translated into a url that you can copy and paste directly here. You don't need to save the issue._

# The 2020 Research Repositories Workshops 
We’ve been hard at work on the #research_repositories project and we’re ready for the next phase: a set of experience mapping workshops around the globe where we each can reflect on our experiences interacting with libraries of research data. 
_add what the outcome will be as a reason to be involved_

## We need your help!
_This section is for the calls-to-action that are most critical to the project right now and will evolve as we go -- but that does mean we need to have any links included here available in other sections more permanently_

### Organise a Workshop
* [Sign up as a workshop organiser](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ch9bDJdmQlMFwm4_4MsRpjh4ZxyjCM_v5Mi61kzuuPQ/viewform?edit_requested=true). Take a look at what is involved in the [Everything You Need To Know](#anchor-organisers-everything-to-know)section below. And we are here to support you! Once you have signed up, we ask that you join us for an [organiser briefing] to help you get started. So far, 55 organisers have raised their hands to hold workshops in 20 countries. 

### Attend a Workshop
* Or you can join a workshop as an attendee. [Register your interest](link) and then check the [Map of Workshops](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1rRM3nncH5YOkL1aCzwFskF0Vzk1vbRoo&ll=20.819791416066206%2C6.252782455528518&z=3) to find one near you, or join an [online workshop]. Learn more in the [Everything You Need To Know](#anchor-attendees-everything-to-know) section below.

## Experience Mapping Workshops
_this section covers the way we are using experience mapping and what we intend to get out of the workshops. all the links to materials and apps are housed in this section. we can also include how we will be capturing / collating / analysing the data._

#### Outreach and Event Language

### Workshop Attendees: [Everything you need to know](#anchor-attendees-everything-to-know)
* Find in-person workshops here: (link to map) or join an online workshop: (link to schedule of online workshops)
* Know before you go: (all the stuff to know about attending, and this is an opportunity to enable folks to self-select in or out based on having actual experience with repositories.)

### Analysing the Data
Once the experience maps are complete, we are faced with getting all of that data into a spot for analysis and synthesis. Stay tuned for more on that, but for now we can say that it will involve airtable and festive analysis parties all over the globe.
