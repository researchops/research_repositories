# The Research Repositories Project 
Last year, we kicked off another global effort within the [ResearchOps Community](https://researchops.community/) -- to explore how we can contribute to the fast-changing field of research repositories. 

> A research repository is any platform, system, drive, database, content collaboration tool, library, knowledge base, wiki, or file cabinet that stores research data, notes, transcripts, images, videos, recordings, findings, insights, reports, metadata, etc. to support consumption and reuse by the entire team. And yes, that means that every researcher is interacting with a “repository” already. 

We have embarked on a series of research activities, both online and in-person, to understand how people think about and interact with their libraries of research data. Using 1:1 interviews, surveys, experience mapping workshops, and diary studies, we are defining the nature of the problem space, the user needs, patterns of reasoning and guiding principles, understanding the types of artifacts that people have or plan to store, and the processes, interactions, and decisions involved in creating and ethically using research repositories. 

Our intention with this project is to leverage the community to conduct research, map out the problem space, construct shared definitions, taxonomies, and models, prescribe good governance and guidelines, and develop guidance for building, comparing, and evaluating research repositories. But the truly worthwhile parts happen along the way, as we create opportunities for researchers to reflect on the work they have done and the ways they want to grow as practitioners and leaders, to engage with members of the community in their own locales or across the globe to commiserate, support, and learn from each other, and to create a path forward together in the land of research repositories.

## Workstreams

### Research
The team working on Repository Governance are coming together to create frameworks which involves global PII, GDPR, Consent & Privacy, Ethics for collecting, storing and sharing data; promoting best practices to help researchers protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of those involved in managing repositories.

The projects include:

_**for Mark** -- below is an example of including an image. the trick is to go to Issues on the top page menu, then hit the Add a new issue button, and then drag your image file into the big box, where it will be translated into a url that you can copy and paste directly here. You don't need to save the issue._
