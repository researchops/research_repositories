# The Research Repositories Project 
Last year, we kicked off another global effort within the [ResearchOps Community](https://researchops.community/) -- to explore how we can contribute to the fast-changing field of research repositories. This is one part of that effort: a set of experience mapping workshops around the globe where we each can reflect on our experiences interacting with libraries of research data. 
Welcome! 
We’re so excited that you’re considering joining us for the research repositories project. This is an ambitious project made possible only by y’all volunteering.

More of a visual person? This is also available in Mural format: https://app.mural.co/t/researchopscommunity7839/m/researchopscommunity7839/1561552976295/8c67bcc9f81501c291646073eb53069580347a0e

Catch up on the history of the project and ask questions in Guide to the Research Repos project
Start with the project brief. This explains more about what the project is about and who it is for.
Review the soft gantt. The work has been broken down into several streams and roughly mapped to a timeline. Sign-up for the work that interests you on tab 4. Repos Project Plan
Reach out to the workstream lead to learn more about the current status and work:

The folders for the project can be found here: 
A shared folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yannOYTIm_-Gl0RkgN9WsYAncEUfjLr7?usp=sharing 
In this folder is a giant spreadsheet where all the stuff is being gathered. You should find the 'word salad', which is the way we are currently gathering terms for the taxonomy and the glossary.

# The 2020 Research Repositories Workshops 
Last year, we kicked off another global effort within the [ResearchOps Community](https://researchops.community/) -- to explore how we can contribute to the fast-changing field of research repositories. This is one part of that effort: a set of experience mapping workshops around the globe where we each can reflect on our experiences interacting with libraries of research data. _add what the outcome will be as a reason to be involved_
