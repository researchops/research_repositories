# The 2020 Research Repositories Project 
Last year, we kicked off another global effort within the [ResearchOps Community](https://researchops.community/) -- to explore how we can contribute to the fast-changing field of research repositories. This is one part of that effort: a set of experience mapping workshops around the globe where we each can reflect on our experiences interacting with libraries of research data.
