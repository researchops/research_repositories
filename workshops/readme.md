# The 2020 Research Repositories Workshops 
We’ve been hard at work on the #research_repositories project and we’re ready for the next phase: a set of **experience mapping workshops** around the globe where we each can reflect on our experiences interacting with libraries of research data. 
_add what the outcome will be as a reason to be involved_

## We need your help!
_This section is for the calls-to-action that are most critical to the project right now and will evolve as we go -- but that does mean we need to have any links included here available in other sections more permanently_
